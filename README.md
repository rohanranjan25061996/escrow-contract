An escrow agreement is a contract that outlines the terms and conditions between parties involved, and the responsibility of each. Escrow agreements generally involve an independent third party, called an escrow agent, who holds an asset of value until the specified conditions of the contract are met.

In this app Seller or Byuer can make deal, any on them can create contract here, after the deal discussion both can initaite the deal, it must be initiate by both parties, then buyer can deposit his amount to smart contract and after the coniform payment by buyer only deal will complete. In mid of these process, if some agreements which not satisy either seller or buyer, they have option to cancel the deal and deal again become to initial state, if amount is deposited by buyer to smart contract then amount will be refunded in buyer account.

Note: If deal will coniform by buyer then buyer or seller have no option to cancel the deal.
